name: Example Link Checker Action

# As an example, this probably has all the essential elements. We could test it
# out straightforwardly in a fork, if forks did netlify builds (sadly there is
# no easy way to make that work without additional netlify accounts - we can
# try Fermyon Cloud tho, I hear bartholomew docs include a sitemap rhai script)
